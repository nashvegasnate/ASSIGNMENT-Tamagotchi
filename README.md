## Overview
The Tamagotchi is a virtual pet that you can take care of and control. There are four quadrants assigned to different actions: eat, play, sleep, and fight.

The eat function starts at 100 and its values can decrease by 3 points if you feed your Tamgotchi unhealthy food, however, that amount can increase by 10 points if you feed it healthy food.
The play function starts at 50 and its values can increase by 2 points for activities that are slightly fun or by 50 points for super fun activities.
The sleep function starts at 50 and its values can increase by either 50 points for taking a nap or by 60 points for deep slumber.
The fight function starts at 100 and its values can decrease by 10 points for having the Tamagotchi commit violence or increase by 1 point for running away.
None of the values can reach more than 100.
